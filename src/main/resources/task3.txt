Requirement:

We would like to introduce the concept of item category and expand our discount policies to the entire category.
If the client buys more than 3 items of the product within the same category, we are giving him 10% discount for all product in this category.

Example:

Given 3 products:
 -> name: tea, pricePerUnit: 5.3, quantity: 2, category: drinks
 -> name: coffee, pricePerUnit: 3.5, quantity: 2, category: drinks
 -> name: cheese, pricePerUnit: 8, quantity: 2, category: food

Expected total is: 9.54 (for tea) + 6.30 (for coffee) + 16 (for cheese) = 31.84
